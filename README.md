**this is my repository to store some of my first  python program files**
**I hope to keep updating it**
## Update 1: Problems from HackerRank and Upgrad

Yea! Dated: 9-07-2020, I actually started practising again. This time, I'll end with most basic commands of python and also start with ML and AI, both of which are actually a part of my university electives this semester. In addition, I have decided to participate in Kaggle problem solving too. For me, python saw a break of almost 2 years, and here I am back!

## Update 2: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
<ul>
  <li> NumPy consists of a robust data structure called multidimensional arrays. </li>
  <li> Matplotlib gives you the ability to visualise data using meaningful plots. </li>
  <li>Pandas is another powerful Python library that provides a fast and easy-to-use data analysis platform. </li>
  </ul>
